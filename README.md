## Overview 

This simple blog site was made on week 11 of the 16-week software development bootcamp, the School of Code as my first experience with Next.js.

It was good to get to know how routing worked in Next.js and the skills I leaned here, I would later us on my [portfolio website](https://github.com/dannykryan/habitap) and my project, [Habitap](https://github.com/dannykryan/habitap).

## The Future

All of the blogs are being populated from a simple json file and if the project was to continue, it would be good to add full CRUD functionality to the application to make it usable.
